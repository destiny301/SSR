def gumbel_sigmoid(logits: Tensor, tau: float = 1, hard: bool = False, threshold: float = 0.5) -> Tensor:
    """
    Samples from the Gumbel-Sigmoid distribution and optionally discretizes.
    The discretization converts the values greater than `threshold` to 1 and the rest to 0.
    The code is adapted from the official PyTorch implementation of gumbel_softmax:
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/nn/functional.html#gumbel_softmax

    Args:
      logits: `[..., num_features]` unnormalized log probabilities
      tau: non-negative scalar temperature
      hard: if ``True``, the returned samples will be discretized,
            but will be differentiated as if it is the soft sample in autograd
     threshold: threshold for the discretization,
                values greater than this will be set to 1 and the rest to 0

    Returns:
      Sampled tensor of same shape as `logits` from the Gumbel-Sigmoid distribution.
      If ``hard=True``, the returned samples are descretized according to `threshold`, otherwise they will
      be probability distributions.
